spotty: a thingy to get around ads that I've worked on for far too long!
current things:
Both spotty and spotty_test now have handlers, which lets them quit normally!
Unfortunately quitting spotify (the app) now doesn't work nicely?
Occasionally, I seem to be getting a -1712 error which happens when AppleEvents time out
